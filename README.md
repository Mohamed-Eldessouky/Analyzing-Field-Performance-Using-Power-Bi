# Analyzing-Field-Performance-Using-Power-Bi
The project main target is to replace traditional methods of reviewing offset wells with a new brilliant and efficient method using Microsoft Power BI Desktop. 
### The report is divided into two main parts: Reservoir and Gas Lift 
**The reservoir part** has various interactive charts for comparing PLT data of offset wells, reviewing offset producers performance and reviewing the reservoir performance using static reservoir pressure data and water injection history. In addition, there Q & A section to quickly retrieve any data.

<br>**The gas lift part** has a chart for comparing TVD of all offset wells gas lift valves with their types in order to optimize the injection depth, in addition to gas lift and static surveys to review offset well performance.

<br>Overall, this new brilliant method introduces a new efficient, quick and easy approach for reviewing offset wells and optimizing the field performance.
